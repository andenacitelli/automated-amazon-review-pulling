It is also very superior for vegetable gardening and lawns!  I was totally impressed with the Single Packets!  They are time-saving and VERY fast & easy to use.  (And I no longer have to lug the container around with me to do my fertilizing.  These Singles fit in my pocket, which is so handy!!)  Thanks, Miracle Gro!!!!

    Super easy to use!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023,I’m terrible at plants.  I’ve been trying for years to keep my outdoor pots looking nice but never have success.  I know I need to give them plant food, but was never sure about what kind, how much, etc.  These singles are perfect.  They are so easy to use.  Just dump 1-2 in my watering can and go.  I’ve being using it 1-2 times a month and have been very pleased with the results.  My plants are so nice that the deer keep coming back to eat them.  So at least you know they were flowing , healthy, and delicious!  But at least they have looked better this year than before.  Will definitely purchase again.
